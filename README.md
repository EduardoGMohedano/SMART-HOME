Smart Home project

This project is meant to build a web server which will help us to serve a WEB UI through a web browser,
such interface all html, css and javascript files are stored on flash chip memory.

This project includes the handling of digital inputs and outputs that will be shown and/or controlled through the WEB UI,
we are using a temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 as input.

Whereas as digital output we have a bulb connected to AC controlled through a relay.
